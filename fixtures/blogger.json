    "bio": "Dmitry was born on the 21-st of October 1967 in Kyiv to a Jewish family. His father, Ilya Gordon, was a civil engineer [3] and his mother, Mina Gordon, was an engineer-economist. Gordon started school at the age of six and finished it at 15.[4] During his school years, he read a lot, was interested in the history of the Revolution, the Civil War and the Great Patriotic War. He was also keen on theatre, modern music and football. When he was in the fifth grade, he wrote about one hundred letters to famous people asking them to send him their photos with the signature. He got two replies: from Leonid Utyosov and Iosif Kobzon.[4]\r\n\r\nIn 1988, he graduated from Kyiv Civil Engineering Institute. To tell the truth, as he recalls, all five institute years were a complete torture as this occupation was not his cup of tea.[5] In his second year he started to collaborate with the leading Kyiv newspapers. During his years of study he published in the best Ukrainian newspapers such as \"Vechirniy Kyiv\" (literally \"Evening Kyiv\"), \"Komsomolskoye Znamya\" (literally \"The Banner of Komsomol\"), \"Molodaya Ukraina\" (literally \"Young Ukraine\"), \"Sportivnaya Gazeta\" (literally \"Sports Newspaper\"), \"Molodaya Gvardiya\" (literally \"The Young Guard\"), \"Prapory Komynizmy\" (literally \"Banners of Communism\"), and \"Komsomolskaya Pravda\" (literally \"Komsomol Truth\"). After the graduation Gordon worked for the newspapers \"Vechirniy Kyiv\", \"Kievskiye Vedomosti\" (literally \"Kyiv Bulletin\") and \"All-Ukraine Vedomosti\" (literally \"All-Ukraine Bulletin\").\r\n\r\nSince 1995, he has been editing his own newspaper, a weekly of society columns \"Boulevard\" (since 2005 \"Gordon Boulevard\"). Today in Ukraine \"Gordon Boulevard\" is one of the most popular newspapers with high circulation. The readers of the weekly count more than 2.5 million people. The newspaper is distributed in Russia, the United States, Israel, Spain, Italy and Germany as well.[6]\r\n\r\nIn June 2019, one month before the July 2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election, Gordon became the head of the election headquarters of the party Strength and Honor.[2]\r\n\r\nGordon is the father of seven children. The elder son, Rostislav (born in 1992), is the student of Kyiv Institute of International Relations.[7] The second son Dmitry, (born in 1995), is the four times champion of Europe in united combat sport in youth age group. He is also a composer of instrumental music and he plays the piano.[8] Since 2012, he is a student of Berklee College of Music in Boston. Elizaveta (born in 1999) and Lev (born in 2001) are schoolchildren. His wife is Alesia Batsman – the editor of \"Shuster Live\". With Alesia, they have three daughters: Santa (2012), Alice (2016), Liana (2019). ",

    "bio": "Volodymyr Oleksandrovych Zelenskyy (Ukrainian: Володимир Олександрович Зеленський; born 25 January 1978), commonly transliterated as Zelensky, is a Ukrainian politician, former actor and comedian, who is the sixth and incumbent president of Ukraine.\r\n\r\nZelenskyy grew up as a native Russian speaker in Kryvyi Rih, a major city of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast in central Ukraine. Prior to his acting career, he obtained a degree in law from the Kyiv National Economic University. He then pursued comedy and created the production company Kvartal 95, which produced films, cartoons, and TV shows including the TV series Servant of the People, in which Zelenskyy played the role of the Ukrainian president. The series aired from 2015 to 2019 and was immensely popular. A political party bearing the same name as the television show was created in March 2018 by employees of Kvartal 95.\r\n\r\nZelenskyy announced his candidacy in the 2019 Ukrainian presidential election on the evening of 31 December 2018, alongside the New Year's Eve address of then-president Petro Poroshenko on the TV channel 1+1. A political outsider, he had already become one of the frontrunners in opinion polls for the election. He won the election with 73.23 per cent of the vote in the second round, defeating Poroshenko. He has positioned himself as an anti-establishment and anti-corruption figure.\r\n\r\nAs president, Zelenskyy has been a proponent of e-government and unity between the Ukrainian- and Russian-speaking parts of the country's population. His communication style heavily uses social media, particularly Instagram. His party won a landslide victory in a snap legislative election held shortly after his inauguration as president. During his administration, Zelenskyy oversaw the lifting of legal immunity for members of the Verkhovna Rada, the country's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent economic recession, and some progress in tackling corruption in Ukraine.\r\n\r\nZelenskyy promised to end Ukraine's protracted conflict with Russia as part of his presidential campaign, and has attempted to engage in dialogue with Russian president Vladimir Putin. Zelenskyy's administration faced an escalation of tensions with Russia in 2021, culminating in the launch of an ongoing full-scale Russian invasion in February 2022. Zelenskyy's strategy during the Russian military buildup was to calm the Ukrainian populace and assure the international community that Ukraine was not seeking to retaliate. He initially distanced himself from warnings of an imminent war, while also calling for security guarantees and military support from NATO to \"withstand\" the threat. After the start of the invasion, Zelenskyy declared martial law across Ukraine and a general mobilisation of the armed forces. His leadership during the crisis has won him widespread international admiration, and he has been described as a symbol of Ukrainian resistance.",

He has short, spiky, pale blue hair and thin black eyebrows, and scarlet-red eyes. On the left side of his jaw and extending down to his neck, he has a large scar given to him by Meliodas.\n\nAt the end of the Baste Dungeon Arc, he is shown wearing a red leather jacket and pants with metal studs sewn into both alongside shoes of a similar, yet darker color.\n\nTen years ago, Ban wore a full set of red armor with a helmet like the rest of his teammates and wielded either a three-sectioned staff or a rapier. During his imprisonment at the Baste Dungeon, his hair had grown past his shoulders, and he had also grown a large beard and mustache. However, soon after escaping his cell, he utilized Jericho's attacks to trim away his facial hair and to reduce his long hairstyle.\n\nDue to losing his shirt during his fight against King in the Capital of the Dead Arc, Ban decided to wear an apron until he was able to find a similar set of clothes during the Vaizel Fight Festival. His Seven Deadly Sins symbol of the Fox is located above his waist on his left side. His wanted poster image, which is slightly accurate, depicts him with long hair that extends past his shoulders. The image also displays a clear view of his distinctive scar.\n\nAfter leaving the Boar Hat, Ban wore a dark red long coat. The long coat has a wide, open collar which exposes a large amount of his chest and has a brown belt with a silver buckle. The bottom half of the long coat flares out and has pockets. He is shown wearing his old red leather pants with metal studs sewn into the forearms of the coat alongside shoes of a similar, yet darker color.\n\nIn Purgatory, Ban wears a long-sleeved red jacket with a leopard-like pattern design, made with the skin of the local species; it has a high collar that slopes backward, and the jacket is wide open reaching up to his pectoral muscles, exposing his upper-body. His pants are yellowish-green and feature black blotches on the right side. ",
